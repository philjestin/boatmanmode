# Add health check endpoint

Add a simple HTTP health check endpoint at `/health` that returns a 200 OK status with a JSON response containing:
- `status`: "healthy"
- `timestamp`: current time in ISO 8601 format
- `version`: application version from config

The endpoint should be implemented following existing API patterns in the codebase.
